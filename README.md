This repository contains a collection of code, figures and data

## Purpose of the project 
The purpose of the  project is to do Exploratory Data Analysis of on Gapminder Dataset

## Data Description

-The Name of the data set is Gapminder. The dataset contains data about country, Year, life-expectancy, income, population  and region of all the countries in the world beginning from 1800 till 2015

-The source of this dataset is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdsarah/pydata-nc/master/tutorial/assets/gapminder.csv

-It contains 41285 rows/observations and 6 variables/columns

## Setting up Questions 
Question 1  Examine usual life expectancy for different years.
Question 2 Evaluate the change in life expectancy over a period of time on different regions?
Question 3 Show the maximum and minimum of income for all regions.Use year 2008 as reference
Question 4 Analyse the spread of income within the regions.
Question 5 Show the number and/or proportion of countries with low life expectancy over time by region.
Question 6 Find countries with substantial departures,sudden from the temporal trend in income


## Analysis
See the Code folder for output and RMD file

## Summary/Conclusion: Overall we can conclude that Life expectancy increases  over the years. However it is not conclusive that the factors effecting life expectancy are income,population. There can be other factors effecting the life expectancy as well and more research needs to be done to find the reason for increase in life expectancy.Having said that income and population do provide us with significant insights to draw conclusion.As we summarize this we also see that life expectancy  is maximum in Europe and Americas and Central Asia. And we see that Sub-Saharan Africa has been the lowest in terms of Life Expectancy. But again there are various factors that effect these stats. Income and population surely plays a  role and we cannot deny that but more substantial data is needed to reach to any conclusion
