## 5.2.4 Exercises

Find all flights that:

Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

```{r}
## Using the filter function
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```

Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

```{r}
##Using the filter function
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
```

Were operated by United, American, or Delta

```{r}
##Using the filter function
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))
```

Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
```{r}
##Using the filter function
filter(flights, month %in% 7:9)
```

Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

```{r}
##Using the filter function and the predicate as per the column and question
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)
```

Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

```{r}
# For example, if there is a  dep_delay of 10 minutes  then arr_delay should be
# 10 - 10 = 0, so air time was on time.
# If dep_delay is 10 minutes late but arr_delay  is -30 minutes earlier, then
# arr_delay SHOULD'VE been 10 but instead is -30 (because of 30 catch up), so
# 10 - (-30) = 20.
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, (dep_delay - arr_delay > 30))
```

Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
```{r}
## filtering as per the predicate 
filter(flights, dep_time >= 2400 | dep_time <= 600)
```

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

```{r}
## between function gives us the range results
filter(flights, between(dep_time, 601, 2359))
```

How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
```{r}
##checking for missing na values and summing it up 
sum(is.na(flights$dep_time))
map_dbl(flights, ~ sum(is.na(.x)))
```

Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)
## Because anything that is `^ 0` = `1`.Because NA | TRUE is saying whether one of the two is `TRUE`((boolean OR) and the second one is. Because at least one of the two expressions can be tested:FALSE & NA. In NA & NA nothing can be tested and the results is `NA & NA`.

##The general rule is that whenever there is a logical expressions, the result shouldnt be 'NA' if one can be tested. the inputting `NA` does not affect the result when the results is determined, regardless of the number. 


# 5.3.1 Exercises

How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use is.na()).
```{r}
## using is.na to sort all missing values
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA),
             y = c(2, NA, 2))
rowSums(df)
arrange(df, desc(is.na(x)))
arrange(df, -(is.na(x)))
```
We're actually saying, those which have value `TRUE` to being `NA`, sort  in descending.

Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.
```{r}
## Sorting the flights based on the flight that left earliest
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

Sort flights to find the fastest flights.
```{r}
## Fastest flight is given by the airtime
arrange(flights, air_time)
```

Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?
```{r}
# Shortest
flights %>%
  arrange(air_time) %>%
  select(carrier, flight, air_time)
# Fastest
flights %>%
  arrange(-air_time) %>%
  select(carrier, flight, air_time)
```
# 5.4.1 Exercises
Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.

```{r}
## Selecting different variables using the select function
vars <- c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, starts_with("dep"), starts_with("arr"))
select(flights, one_of(vars))
select_(flights, .dots = vars)
select_(flights, "dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
select(flights, matches("dep"), matches("arr"), -matches("sched"), -carrier)
select(flights, contains("dep"), contains("arr"), -contains("sched"), -carrier)
select(flights, matches("^dep|^arr"))
select(flights, matches("time$|delay$"), -contains("sched"), -contains("air"))
select(flights, matches("^dep|arr_delay|time$"))
```

What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?

```{r}
## By default it will return one once even though the variable is called multiple times
select(flights, dep_time, dep_time)
```


What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?
```{r}
##By including inside `one_of()`  function we can use character names.
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
select(flights, one_of(vars))
```


Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

By default, each select_helper function ignore the cases of the variables.

```{r}

select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

With this command you can read each name as literal:
```{r}
## Contains function gives you the results based on the condaition that conatins that parameters
select(flights, contains("TIME", ignore.case = F))
```
# 5.5.2 Exercises
Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they're not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

```{r}
hours2mins <- function(x) {
  x %/% 100 * 60 + x %% 100
}
# with integer division
mutate(flights,
       dep_time = hours2mins(dep_time),
       sched_dep_time = hours2mins(sched_dep_time))
# with rounding operations
mutate(flights,
       dep_time = 60 * floor(dep_time/100) + (dep_time - floor(dep_time/100) * 100),
       sched_dep_time = 60 * floor(sched_dep_time/100) + (sched_dep_time - floor(sched_dep_time/100) * 100))
```

Compare air_time with arr_time - dep_time. What do you expect to see? 
```{r}
##Arrival time minus departure time gives us the air time
flights %>% 
  mutate(dep_time = (dep_time %/% 100) * 60 + (dep_time %% 100),
         sched_dep_time = (sched_dep_time %/% 100) * 60 + (sched_dep_time %% 100),
         arr_time = (arr_time %/% 100) * 60 + (arr_time %% 100),
         sched_arr_time = (sched_arr_time %/% 100) * 60 + (sched_arr_time %% 100)) %>%
  transmute((arr_time - dep_time) %% (60*24) - air_time)
```


Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

```{r}
## These variables will help us to calculate the air time 
hours2mins <- function(x) {
  x %/% 100 * 60 + x %% 100
}
select(flights, contains("dep")) %>%
  mutate(dep_time_two = hours2mins(dep_time) - hours2mins(sched_dep_time))
# these two numbers don't match because we aren't accounting for flights
# where the departure time is the next day from the scheduled departure time.
select(flights, contains("dep")) %>%
  mutate(dep_time_two = hours2mins(dep_time) - hours2mins(sched_dep_time)) %>%
  filter(dep_delay != dep_time_two) %>%
  mutate(dep_time_two = hours2mins(dep_time) - hours2mins(sched_dep_time - 2400))
# There it is fixed!
```

Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().

```{r}
## Finding the top flights using the rank function
flights %>%
  filter(min_rank(-(dep_delay)) %in% 1:10)
flights %>%
  top_n(10, dep_delay)
```

What does 1:3 + 1:10 return? Why?
It wil return:
```{r}
##Because `1:3` is recycleed.
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, 8, 10, 12, 11)
p <- 1:3 + 1:10
p == x
```



What trigonometric functions does R provide?

# 5.6.7 Exercises

Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:

```{r}
## Delay characteristic of group flights
delay_char <-
  flights %>%
  group_by(flight) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            fifteen_early = mean(arr_delay == -15, na.rm = T),
            fifteen_late = mean(arr_delay == 15, na.rm = T),
            ten_always = mean(arr_delay == 10, na.rm = T),
            thirty_early = mean(arr_delay == -30, na.rm = T),
            thirty_late = mean(arr_delay == 30, na.rm = T),
            percentage_on_time = mean(arr_delay == 0, na.rm = T),
            twohours = mean(arr_delay > 120, na.rm = T)) %>%
  map_if(is_double, round, 2) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.

```{r}
delay_char %>%
  filter(fifteen_early == 0.5, fifteen_late == 0.5)
```

A flight is always 10 minutes late.

```{r}
delay_char %>%
  filter(ten_always == 1)
```

A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.

```{r}
delay_char %>%
  filter(thirty_early == 0.5 & thirty_late == 0.5)
```

99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it's 2 hours late.

```{r}
delay_char %>%
  filter(percentage_on_time == 0.99 & twohours == 0.01)
```

Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?

It depends

Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as:
```{r}
not_cancelled <-
  flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
not_cancelled %>%
  count(dest)
# and
not_cancelled %>%
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)
# (without using count()).
#######################
not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
# and
not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  tally(wt = distance)
# or
not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(distance))
```

Our definition of cancelled flights `(is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay) )` is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

Because a flight was cancelled if a flight did not  leave. If the condition `is.na(dep_delay)` is true, then the flight was cancelled.

Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_delay)),
            mean_dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
            mean_arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = cancelled)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mean_dep), colour = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(x = mean_arr), colour = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Avg delay per day", y = "Cancelled flights p day")
```

It appears there is a +ve relationship. 

Which carrier has the worst delays?

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(dep_max = max(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
            arr_max = max(arr_delay, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_max, arr_max)) %>%
  filter(1:n() == 1)
```

Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()))

It might be possible.  
```{r}
flights %>%
  summarise(n_car = n_distinct(carrier),
            n_air = n_distinct(dest),
            n_or = n_distinct(origin))
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  mutate(avg_carrier = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>%
  group_by(carrier, origin) %>%
  mutate(origin_mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
         deviations = origin_mean - avg_carrier) %>%
  summarise(deviations = mean(deviations), mean = mean(avg_carrier)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(origin, deviations)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~ carrier)
```



```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier, dest) %>%
  summarise(mean_departure = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
            mean_arrival = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T))
```

For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.

```{r}
flights %>%
    mutate(dep_date = time_hour) %>%
    group_by(tailnum) %>%
    arrange(dep_date) %>%
    mutate(cumulative = !cumany(arr_delay > 60)) %>%
    filter(cumulative == T) %>%
    tally(sort = TRUE)
```

or

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  arrange(time_hour) %>%
  mutate(cum = arr_delay > 60,
         cum_any = cumsum(cum)) %>%
  filter(cum_any < 1) %>%
  tally(sort = TRUE)
```

What does the sort argument to count() do. When might you use it?

When you want to sort the cases based on the count.
```{r}
flights %>%
  count(flight, sort = T)
```

## 5.7.1 Exercises

Refer back to the table of useful mutate and filtering functions. Describe how each operation changes when you combine it with grouping.

Which one?

Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(prop_time = sum(arr_delay <= 30)/n(),
            mean_arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T),
            fl = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop_time))
```

These flights are always late.

What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  summarise( delay = mean( dep_delay > 0 , na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(hour, delay, fill = delay)) + geom_col() 
# or
flights %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarize(m = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            low_ci = m - 2*sd,
            high_ci = m + 2*sd,
            n = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(hour, m, ymin = low_ci, ymax = high_ci)) +
  geom_pointrange()
```

Bad time to fly is in the early evening. because that is the time when more flights go out  happens because more flights go out.

For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each, flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  summarise(tot_mins = sum(dep_delay[dep_delay > 0]))
flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  group_by(tailnum, dest) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(dep_delay > 0), n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(m))
```

Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag() explore how the delay of a flight is related to the delay of the immediately preceding flight.

```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(new_sched_dep_time = lubridate::make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute)) %>%
  arrange(new_sched_dep_time) %>%
  mutate(prev_time = lag(dep_delay)) %>%
  # filter(between(dep_delay, 0, 300), between(prev_time, 0, 300)) %>% # play with this one
  select(origin, new_sched_dep_time, dep_delay, prev_time) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dep_delay, prev_time)) + geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  geom_smooth()
# or
flights %>%
  select(year, month, day, hour, dest, dep_delay) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  mutate(lag_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%
  arrange(dest) %>%
  filter(!is.na(lag_delay)) %>%
  summarize(cor = cor(dep_delay, lag_delay, use = "complete.obs"),
            n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(cor)) %>%
  filter(row_number(desc(cor)) %in% 1:10)
```

Although there is a lot of noise, you can see a sort of straight line going on there. There is also a correlation between the lagged values in many of the destionatinons. So correlation between flights is mostly in specific airports.

Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?

```{r}
# (1)
flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  arrange(air_time) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(tailnum, sched_dep_time, sched_arr_time, air_time) %>%
  arrange(air_time)
# (2)
flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  mutate(shortest = air_time - min(air_time, na.rm = T)) %>%
  top_n(1, air_time) %>%
  arrange(-air_time) %>%
  select(tailnum, sched_dep_time, sched_arr_time, shortest)
```

Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use that information to rank the carriers.

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  filter(n_distinct(carrier) > 2) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(n = n_distinct(dest)) %>%
  arrange(-n)
```

 For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.
```{r}
flights %>%
    mutate(dep_date = lubridate::make_datetime(year, month, day)) %>%
    group_by(tailnum) %>%
    arrange(dep_date) %>%
    filter(!cumany(arr_delay>60)) %>%
    tally(sort = TRUE)
```
